 * 
 * APR's Version
 *
 * There are several different mechanisms for accessing the version. There
 * is a string form, and a set of numbers; in addition, there are constants
 * which can be compiled into your application, and you can query the library
 * being used for its actual version.
 *
 * Note that it is possible for an application to detect that it has been
 * compiled against a different version of APR by use of the compile-time
 * constants and the use of the run-time query function.
 *
 * APR version numbering follows the guidelines specified in:
 *
 *     http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html
