RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


CURRENT VOTES:


CURRENT test/testall -v EXCEPTIONS:

    Please add any platform anomilies to the following exception list.

    * Entries from 2003 removed.  Then-old versions of Solaris and OpenBSD
      referenced.

    * Win32 Not Implemented tests (2007: is any of this still true?)
        poll: pollcb not implemented
        procmutex: lacks fork() support
        sock : Sync behavior causes us to skip one test
        sockets: tcp6_socket/udp6_socket skipped for no IPv6 adapter
        sockopt: TCP isn't corkable
        users: username: Groups from apr_uid_get not implemented

    * (2007: is this still relevant?)
      Win32 tests are known to fail when APR_HAVE_IPV6, but there is no
      ipv6 adapter is loaded (even loopback is sufficient).  There are
      obnoxious getaddrinfo() missing results from looking up a fixed
      IPv4-IPv6 mixed notation address, which reflect a Win32 bug.
        ipsub: One test fails for IPv6 with no IPv6 adapter configured
        sock : One test fails for IPv6 with no IPv6 adapter configured


ONGOING REMINDERS FOR STYLE/SUBSTANCE OF CONTRIBUTING TO APR:

    * Flush out the test suite and make sure it passes on all platforms.
      We currently have about 450 functions in APR and 147 tests.  That
      means we have a large number of functions that we can't verify are
      actually portable.  This TODO includes finishing the migration to the
      unified test suite, and adding more tests to make the suite
      comprehensive.

    * Eliminate the TODO's and XXX's by using the doxygen @bug feature
      to allow us to better track the open issues, and provide historical
      bug lists that help porters understand what was wrong in the old
      versions of APR that they would be upgrading from.

    * Continue to review, deprecate and eliminate from 2.0 all namespace
      un-protected names throughout include/apr_foo.h headers.


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * Removed wishlist from 2002-2007.  Assuming WONTFIX or overtaken
      by events.

Interface Changes Postponed for APR 2.0:

    * Removed more wishlist stuff from 2002-2007.  Things for 2.0
      don't belong here (even if 2.0 as used here may have meant
      what is now 1.x).
