RELEASE 0.9 SHOWSTOPPERS:



CURRENT VOTES:



CURRENT test/testall -v EXCEPTIONS:

    Please add any platform anomilies to the following exception list.

    * All platforms fail tests in time: test_localstr and test_ctime
        Imaginary... the tests can only succeed on machines configured
        for the Pacific (US) timezone.  Test needs to be restructured.
        Ignore these errors.

    * BUG: Win32 fails test in File Info: test_stat_eq_finfo
        apr_stat and apr_getfileinfo differ in protection ... wrowe
        guesses that we are checking the handle objects' permissions
        rather than the filesystem objects' permissions.

    * Win32 Not Implemented tests 
        Pipes: set_timeout/read_write; can't timeout blocking pipes
        Socket Creation: tcp6_socket and udp6_socket (at least by default)
        Socket Options: corkable: TCP isn't corkable
        Users: username: Groups from apr_uid_get not implemented


SEE svn.apache.org:/repos/asf/apr/apr/trunk/STATUS for all other open
issues to be addressed.  [First, patched in trunk; then considered for
backport to the stable branch.]
