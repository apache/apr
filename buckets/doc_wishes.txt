Wishes -- use cases for layered IO
==================================

[Feel free to add your own]

Dirk's original list:
---------------------

This file is there so that I do not have to remind myself
about the reasons for Layered IO, apart from the obvious one.

0. To get away from a 1 to 1 mapping

   i.e. a single URI can cause multiple backend requests, 
   in arbitrary configurations, such as in paralel, tunnel/piped, 
   or in some sort of funnel mode. Such multiple backend
   requests, with fully layered IO can be treated exactly
   like any URI request; and recursion is born :-)

1. To do on the fly charset conversion

   Be, theoretically, be able to send out your content using
   latin1, latin2 or any other charset; generated from static
   _and_ dynamic content in other charsets (typically unicode
   encoded as UTF7 or UTF8). Such conversion is prompted by
   things like the user-agent string, a cookie, or other hints
   about the capabilities of the OS, language preferences and
   other (in)capabilities of the final receipient. 

2. To be able to do fancy templates

   Have your application/cgi sending out an XML structure of
   field/value pair-ed contents; which is substituted into a 
   template by the web server; possibly based on information 
   accessible/known to the webserver which you do not want to 
   be known to the backend script. Ideally that template would
   be just as easy to generate by a backend as well (see 0).

3. On the fly translation

   And other general text and output mungling, such as translating
   an english page in spanish whilst it goes through your Proxy,
   or JPEG-ing a GIF generated by mod_perl+gd.
